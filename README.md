## What is µLink ?

An open sourced licensed URL shortener with enterprise features.

## Why?

Because great features shouldn't be hidden behind paywalls!

## How do i pronounce this?

**µ** ([the greek symbol for Mu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mu_(letter))) is the twelfth letter of the Greek alphabet.  In mathematical terms, it represents a unit prefix denoting a factor of 10<sup>-6</sup> (one millionth). In this context, the symbol name is "micro" in the International System of Units (SI).

I pronounce it _"microlink,"_ however you are welcome to pronounce it mu-link, u-link, or however makes sense to you!

_No GIF/JIFF controversy here._

## Why micro?

- Our project goal is to be light weight, high speed, and feature packed.
- Our development goals are to keep the core side clean and snappy, and the management interface clean, elegant, and easy to use.
- Greek letters are cool.
